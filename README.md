# MusicClassification

This project works on the concept of Signal Processing and Neural Networks.
This is a test project which first takes in samples of Music and tries to study it by converting it into a waveform.
Later using the waveform it is fed into a neural network which later uses a sigmoid function to activate the network and produce an Output.
